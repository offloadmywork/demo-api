- Last run: In progress (3m3s ago, started 2026-02-14T04:59:47Z)
- Previous runs: All successful

## Technical Assessment
- API implementation: Complete CRUD operations
- Input validation: Implemented for POST endpoint
- Missing: PUT endpoints (DELETE was recently implemented)
- Logging: PR #9 in progress to add request logging middleware
- TypeScript: No compilation errors after build
- Dependencies: Express 4.18.2, TypeScript 5.3.3

## Recommendations
1. Review and prioritize the open issues - many seem to be related to OpenClaw App features rather than the core API
2. Address the security vulnerability in dependencies
3. Merge PR #9 once tests pass to improve observability
4. Consider implementing proper error handling middleware
5. Add automated tests for API endpoints

## Next Actions
- Review issue #30 (test for bot response)
- Monitor PR #9 progress
- Address dependency vulnerability
- Update MEMORY.md with findings
