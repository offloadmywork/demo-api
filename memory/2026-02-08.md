# 2026-02-08 - OpenClaw Heartbeat Check

## Repository Status
- Repository: demo-api
- Branch: main
- Last commit: 58141d1 "Update MEMORY.md with heartbeat check findings"
- Git status: Clean, only .openclaw directory untracked

## Project Overview
This is a simple REST API for managing tasks, built with Express and TypeScript.

### Current Implementation
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: In-memory storage (currently reset on restart)
- **Endpoints**:
  - GET /tasks - List all tasks
  - POST /tasks - Create a new task
  - GET /tasks/:id - Get a specific task
  - PUT /tasks/:id - Update a task
  - GET /health - Health check endpoint
  - GET / - Root endpoint

### Missing Features
- DELETE /tasks/:id endpoint (implementation exists but not exposed in routes)
- Input validation for POST /tasks (marked as TODO)
- No persistent storage (data lost on server restart)
- No error handling for edge cases

## GitHub Actions
- OpenClaw bot is configured to run on:
  - Issue events (opened, edited)
  - Issue comments (created)
  - Pull request events (opened, synchronize, reopened)
  - Review comments (created)
  - Scheduled every 6 hours
  - Manual triggers

## Areas for Improvement
1. Implement DELETE endpoint in routes
2. Add input validation for task creation
3. Add persistent storage (database/file-based)
4. Add error handling and logging
5. Add tests
6. Add documentation for endpoints

## Heartbeat Tasks Completed
- Reviewed repository structure
- Analyzed current implementation
- Identified missing features and improvements
- Checked GitHub Actions configuration
- Updated memory with findings
